# Goal
To show an unambiguous example of java's implementation of the Service Design Pattern. This is covered by the Java 11 Certification Exam.

For use in a Naimuri insight/blog post.

## Running The Code as Modules
Running the code as java modules require a slightly different flow than simply using the classpath.
```Bash
javac
jar
java
```

## Note on Branches and Tagging
Unlike their common use in the development lifecycle, the repos I have used branches and tags to represent alternative solutions. Here the branch is used to map the code to a real world example. The code should be the same with the module and class names changed.
